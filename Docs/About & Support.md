# CLEANPC — About & Support

CLEANPC is a modular Windows governance and self‑healing engine designed to keep a system predictable, stable, and clutter‑free.  
It reflects a simple philosophy: computers should work *for* people, not the other way around.

This project was created by **Asim Hashmi**, combining practical system administration experience with a desire for clarity, automation, and long‑term maintainability.

## 💡 Why Shareware?

CLEANPC is free to use — and always will be.  
There are no locked features, no nags, no timers, and no crippleware behaviour.

If CLEANPC has helped you:

- avoid reinstalls  
- fix configuration drift  
- keep Windows stable  
- save time  
- reduce frustration  

…then supporting the project is appreciated, but never required.
